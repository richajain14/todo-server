Todo server side application using NodeJs, Express, MongoDb, Mongoose, socket.io

 Prerequisites

 1. install mongodb locally by following instructions here - https://docs.mongodb.com/manual/administration/install-community/
 2. Node.js 8.0+

 **Note:** If you are new to Node or Express, I recommend to watch
 [Node.js and Express 101](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=BN0JlMZCtNU)
 screencast by Alex Ford that teaches Node and Express from scratch. Alternatively,
 here is another great tutorial for complete beginners - [Getting Started With Node.js, Express, MongoDB](http://cwbuecheler.com/web/tutorials/2013/node-express-mongo/).
